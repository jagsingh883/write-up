Obiedent Cat write up:
for this one you have to download the file and then go to the directory that has the file and cat the file you will find the flag right there

Python Wrangling:
for this one a bit trickey as you need to read the code, so first download the code and then try to run the python file but it won't run unless you have -d command 
after. Eg python3 ende.py -d "name.txt". Next you need to key or the password and then done the key will be decoded and you will have your flag.

Wave a flag:
you need to download the file and then change its mode using the chmod +x to an executable. you might need to use sudo. Once you have done this you have to run the
file using ./warm but you will have a command saying that you need to run it with -h and so ./warm -h and then you will have the flag.

Nice NetCat:
after you use the nc command to connect to the website you will have a whole bunch of decimal numbers that will pop up me being lazy I just used an online tool to turn
decimals into characters and that is how I found the flag.
